.SYNOPSIS
    Runs Uncert_01_Laplacian_Covariance.py (voxel-wise Hessian) for a sweep of
    lambda values, each split across several parallel Python processes on a
    single multi-core Windows workstation.

.DESCRIPTION
    Windows caps a single ProcessPoolExecutor at 61 workers (WaitForMultipleObjects
    hard limit), regardless of how many physical cores the machine has. To use more
    of a big workstation (e.g. 128 cores), this script launches -NJobs separate
    Python processes per lambda, each with its own <=61-worker pool, each handling
    a slice of the brain-voxel list via --vox-start/--vox-end. Lambdas are run one
    at a time (each lambda's jobs use the full core budget); voxel jobs within a
    lambda run in parallel.

    Each job opens in its own real console window (Start-Process, not Start-Job) --
    Uncert_01's own output (including tqdm's live CG-iteration progress bar) is not
    reliable to capture through PowerShell's job/pipe machinery: Start-Job fully
    buffers everything until the job ends, and tqdm redraws with \r (not \n), which
    doesn't survive being piped through subprocess -> job -> Receive-Job -> console
    as separate lines. A real console window sidesteps all of that -- it's just
    Uncert_01 running normally, so you see exactly what you'd see running it by
    hand, including the live CG progress bar, which is what you actually want when
    diagnosing why a run is slow.

    Run-tags are derived as "w<Wmax>_l<lambda>" using Python's own :g formatting
    (via a tiny python -c call) so they exactly match the directory names
    recon_01_run_spice.py actually created - e.g. lambda=1e-4 becomes
    "w5000_l0.0001", not "w5000_l1e-4". Hand-formatting this in PowerShell would
    silently produce mismatched paths for some lambdas (verified: 1e-4, 1e-3,
    3e-3, 4e-3, 1e-2, 1e-1 all fall on the .NET/Python formatting divergence).

    The brain voxel count (used to size each job's --vox-start/--vox-end slice)
    is auto-detected by calling make_brain_mask() with the same threshold/
    erosion/cleanup settings passed to Uncert_01 itself (unless -TotalVoxels is
    given explicitly). Overshooting this (e.g. guessing the full 64x64=4096
    grid when only ~1700 voxels are actually in-brain) does NOT "safely clip" -
    it unbalances the split: with a large enough overshoot, an early job's
    slice can absorb the entire real voxel list while later jobs get an empty
    slice and do nothing.

    Run from the repo root (or anywhere - it cd's to its own location first).
